          <p className="helpcenterDescription">
            To make sure that your account details are always secure,
            verification by OTP (One Time Password) is important. This is a
            one-time process and you can log into your Babaldeals account
            without any hassles once this is done.

            What is an OTP or verification code?
          </p>

          <p className="helpcenterDescription">
            An OTP (One Time Password) or verification code is a password/code
            used to verify your mobile number or email ID when you log into your
            Babaldeals account for the first time. OTP verification will be also
            be done in other cases like creating an account, password recovery,
            and updating email/mobile details.

          <p className="helpcenterDescription">
            As the verification step is a one time process, you won't have to do
            it again once your account is verified.

            Can I use an international number to sign up?

          <p className="helpcenterDescription">
            No, you canâ€™t use International number to sign up. But you can use
            digital wallet to pay.

          <p className="helpcenterDescription">
            Network issues sometimes delay OTP-based SMS. You can regenerate the
            code by clicking 'Resend Code'. In case that doesn't work, you can
            try switching your phone off and back on.
